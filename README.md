# E-Commerce Website Project

This project is a web-based e-commerce platform built using **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Key Principles and Practices Applied

### 1. **MVC Architecture**
The application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, separating concerns:
- **Model:** Contains business logic and data.
- **View:** Displays dynamic content using Thymeleaf templates.
- **Controller:** Manages request handling and communicates with the model and view.

### 2. **Agile Development**
The project follows **Agile methodologies** with development divided into **sprints**, allowing flexibility and iterative improvements.

### 3. **Version Control with Git**
The code is managed using **Git**, ensuring version control, collaboration, and traceability of changes.

### 4. **Security**
We use **Spring Security** for authentication, authorization, and securing sensitive user information.

### 5. **Layered Architecture**
The system is divided into layers:
- **Presentation Layer:** Frontend (HTML, JS, Tailwind CSS) for user interaction.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Service classes in Spring Boot to handle core operations.
- **Data Access Layer:** JPA/Hibernate for database interactions.

### 6. **Responsive Design**
The frontend is built using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring the application is responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### 7. **Project Management**
Tasks are managed using tools like **Jira** and **Trello**, ensuring efficient task distribution and progress tracking.

### 8. **CI/CD Pipeline**
The application is deployed with **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** for automated testing and deployment to production.

### 9. **Monitoring and Logging**
The system is monitored, and logs are maintained for efficient issue tracking and debugging.
